Welcome to my page! I am a graduate student pursuing Masters in Computer Science at North Carolina State University. During my time at NC State University, I have taken courses in the domain of Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, Statistics, Database Management and Algorithms. I have had the opportunity to experience both a research-based and an operations-based work environment to work on challenging real-world problems across various industries including but not limited to Healthcare, Retail, Finance and Social media.

I am interested in opportunities that involve the entire data science project iterative life cycle, from data collection to model deployment. My skills and area of expertise lie in leveraging data to gain useful insights, which may be instrumental in expanding business, maximizing profits, reducing costs or benefiting the society. I have experience working with healthcare or/and medical data and social media data (comments, posts) to name a few. 

Check out my [Projects](/projects/) page for more details.

Feel free to contact me via email or connect with me on LinkedIn.
