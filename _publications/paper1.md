This paper proposes a low-cost, high-speed solution to the problem of finding and reserving a parking space by leveraging IoT concepts. An android app has been developed to facilitate the user to view available vacant parking slots on the app dashboard. The app includes reservation functionalities to pre-reserve a parking space. The benefits include use of ultrasonic sensors that give correct information about the status of each parking space and using firebase to store status of each parking space.
