## Description

Motif is a short region or subsequence of DNA or protein sequence that has a specific structure
and act as a candidate for functionally important sites.These motifs are useful for finding
Transcription Factor Binding Sites that are crucial for understanding the Genetic Regulatory
System. 
Heuristic algorithms have been implemented to find motifs while maximizing 3 objectives - motif length, motif similarity (consensus score) and surprise factor.
