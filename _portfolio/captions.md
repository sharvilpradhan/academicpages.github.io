## Description
The project aims at developing a model that can perform multiple tasks. The first task being generating textual captions for a given image. The second task being image search for a given keyword/keywords.

## Motivation
The hypothesis was that once the model has generated caption for an image, it knows what text is associated with it. This means that if we now enter a similar text then by a keyword search the model should be able to retrieve that image or other images matching the description.

## Results



## Advantage
This eliminates the need of different models to perform caption generation and image search tasks. Both these tasks can be done using the same neural network architecture.
