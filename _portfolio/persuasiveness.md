## Description
This project aims to develop an automated system that parses through threads on Reddit Change My View (CMV) discussions and gives points to comments that contribute logically to the discussion.

## Motivation
Reddit Change My View is an online forum where a person writes an Original Post (OP) which generally consists of his/her personal opinion about a subject. This post is followed by a thread of coments from different users who are trying to convince the OP to change his/her views by providing supporting argument. The discussion thread generated is very long with a lot of users just writing spam messages or/and writing comments that do not contribute in any way to the OP.

## Objective
The aim or purpose of this project is to identify valid comments that contribute to the discussion initiated by the OP and award points accordingly to each individual comment uder the OP.
